\# Week 2: Modeling \& Imbalance Handling



\## Objective

Build a predictive model to detect rare equipment failures.



\## Work Done

\- Built baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

\- Selected XGBoost for production due to high performance

\- Handled extreme class imbalance using class weights

\- Evaluated model using PR-AUC instead of accuracy



\## Outcome

Developed a high-precision failure prediction model.
