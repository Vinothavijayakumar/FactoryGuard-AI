\# Week 1: Feature Engineering \& Data Understanding



\## Objective

Understand sensor data from industrial equipment and convert raw signals into meaningful time-series features.



\## Work Done

\- Analyzed vibration, temperature, and pressure sensor data

\- Created rolling window features (mean, standard deviation)

\- Generated lag features (t-1, t-2)

\- Used Pandas for efficient feature engineering



\## Outcome

Prepared a clean feature set suitable for predictive maintenance modeling.
